    <p>CIVIL</p>
    <p>Civil engineering is the broadest engineering discipline, focused on the design, 
        construction, and maintenance of the physical and built environment, including public works like roads,
         bridges, dams, buildings, and water systems. It applies principles of physics, math, and geology to create 
         functional, safe, and sustainable infrastructure that supports public health and society's development. Key
          specializations include structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transportation 
        engineering, water resources engineering, environmental engineering, and construction engineering. </p>
